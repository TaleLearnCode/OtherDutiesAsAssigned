## Abstract
"Other duties as assigned" is a phrase included in just about everyone's job description and generally means the tasks that the hiring manager or human resources could not think of when writing the job description.  As a result, employees often do not even get assigned such tasks or hardly notice when performing them.  But what if we sought out such things, embraced them, became better at our jobs, and, in turn, benefited our careers by not only taking on these other duties but seeking them out?  

Chad Green's professional software development career was kickstarted by "other duties as assigned." Over three decades later, Chad has performed many duties that fell outside of his job descriptions.  Learn how he embraced these assignments and improved his core skills through them and how they have made him the leader he is today.
