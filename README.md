## Abstract
“Other duties as assigned.”  This is in just about everyone’s job description and generally means the tasks that the hiring manager or human resources could not think of when they were writing the job description.  A lot of times, employees do not even get assigned with such tasks or they hardly notice when they are performing such tasks.  But what if we sought out such things, embraced them, became better at our jobs, and, in turn, benefited out careers by not only taking on these other duties but seeking them out.  

In over three decades of professional software development experience, Chad Green has performed a lot of duties that did not fall within job description.  As a matter of fact, his professional software development experience started because of “other duties as assigned.”  Learn how Chad embraced these assignments and improved his core skills by them and how they have made him the leader he is today.
